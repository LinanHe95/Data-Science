# Data-Science
## The following project using public acessable data on goverment website. Showing all montor vehicle collisions and crashes. Data to be accessed from NYC Open Data 
## Using technology such as python for this project, but also imported package such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and folium, All those imported packages helps me to create a visual aspect to the data I am using.

## Alot graphs in the Motor vechile crashes and collisions file will not appear, i has created separated file in this folder with matching name for the unvisual ones.

## One of the best skill doing this project is able to analyz the data to specfic data set you wanted, than picking what graph or charts best fit for it. 

## The problems  I has encountered during this project is that I dont know everything to the project. For example: When i decide to create a map visual marker, there is alot more element i need to consider such as longitdude, latitude data and other agruments i need to bring in the function.
## In creating for heat map showing in period of time. The biggest thing had me on hold is to match the data weight of the color matching to the weight of the collision or crashes

## The things i learn from this project is that when doing this type of projects, you never know what you will need to learn on the job and interesting thing you will find. One funny and sad thing I discover while making this project is the amount collisions happens in new york that will create visual map of whole new york state.
